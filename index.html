        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Leo Lin. I am currently a 1st-year pre-business undergraduate student at the University of California, Riverside. In the future, I hope to graduate with my Business degree and find a career in the Big Four. Currently, I am an intern for Goodwin's Organic Grocery Store where I am learning the techniques that makeup Marketing. This has given me insights into the Business world where Marketing and promoting your products correctly makes all the difference in the world. My weekly duties include making Tiktok, captioning photos, and trying to reach a bigger audience on social media. What I hope to gain from this internship is to network with more people in the business world and to gain professional experience. In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym. The gym is like my second home where I can relax and relieve any stress I am having. Lifting is something that I am passionate about and will always continue to do. In high school, I was heavily involved in Key Club, LinkCrew, and Kare 4 Kids. Key Club is a community service club where I was able to give back to the community by helping elders at the retirement home, pack food for homeless shelters, or even cheering for people running a marathon. This helped me be a part of the community and feel like I am a part of something bigger than myself. Link crew was a high school program I was in where we would help students entering high school transition into becoming high schoolers. This helped me gain leadership skills as i was responsible for coming up with events and ideas. I also gained teamwork skills because as a team we were all expected to work together in order to complete our goals. Lastly, I was in Kare 4 Kids which was a club where we would volunteer at childrenâ€™s events. This was a fantastic experience because I got to see smiles on their faces as they were having fun. Something else that I am passionate about are stocks. I am interested in how the market works and the possibility of becoming financially independent. Because of how advanced our society has become, it is no longer essential to attend college to have a successful life. In the future, I hope to gain my financial independence and be able to gain passive income. I currently have a Roth IRA where I contribute money every month for my retirement fund. This is the best way to save money for when I am older because unlike a 401K, it cannot be taxed. With the economy growing at an average of seven percent a year, my money will be growing until the time I am 65 years old. In college, I hope to gain more experience in the business world and find a niche that I am interested in. The business world is quite broad and I hope to find something that I am passionate about that is worth pursuing. I also hope to be able to network and find a mentor that has gone through the same college experience that I am currently going through. <br><br>
